# Keeping Up With Technology Trends
Video will discuss **weak** and **strong** signals of tech trends that tech leaders must keep an eye on.

| Note: *Organization*, *company*, and *enterprise* are used interchangeably by the video speaker.

> [!NOTE] Strong Signals
> 
 > Done **at scale** by a group or organizations;
 > Act as **proof points** for the emerging technology

> [!NOTE] Weak Signals
> 
> In quantity, they may **provide clarity** of emerging technology;
> **Show ways to participate** in the evolution of an emerging technology

> [!NOTE] The Software as a Service (SaaS) Model
> 
> A business model that **allows users to access cloud-based software through a subscription** (e.g. Email, Calendaring, Office tools, Communication tools).

> [!NOTE] Web 2.0
> 
> The **second stage of development of the World Wide Web**.
> A stage where we transition from *static web pages to dynamic or user-generated content*.
> A stage that sees the growth of *social media*.

## Examples of Signals in Tech Trends
### Strong Signals
> [!EXAMPLE] Netflix using Amazon Web Services (AWS)
> 
> As opposed to the mail delivery of DVDs, Netflix built their real-time video streaming platform betting on the environment of AWS to be the underlying public cloud infrastructure to deliver their streaming experience.
> 
> At the time, many organizations did not use public cloud infrastructure to provide their services.

### Weak Signals
> [!EXAMPLE] The Software as a Service (SaaS) Model
> 
> Organizations were late to adopt SaaS. The weak signal arose from the consumer space.
> 
> As Web 2.0 applications and technology stacks began to mature, the SaaS model began emerging in the consumer space.
> *e.g. Blog platform, Podcast platform, Content consumption platform*
> 
> Now many organizations use the SaaS model to deliver their solutions to customers.

> [!EXAMPLE] YouTube
> 
> Many were doubtful about YouTube's video formats (i.e. short and with no context videos to be consumed). But weak signals can become stronger over time.
> 
> Videos plays many roles in our lives *e.g. Entertainment, Education, Telehealth, Industrial training.*
> 
> Proliferated into the current video-based economy we know today.

> [!EXAMPLE] Blackberry
> 
> One of the earliest smart devices with a tactile interface that was preferred for business purposes.
> 
> Blackberry faced competition from touchscreen smartphones.
> 
> Despite there being an initial resistance to adopt touchscreen smartphones, Blackberry phones eventually stopped being produced.

> [!QUESTION] Why must CIOs pay attention to **strong** signals of tech trends?
> 
> To advance their organization's technology architecture/stack.

> [!QUESTION] Why must CIOs pay attention to **weak** signals of tech trends?
> 
> To stay connected with the emerging technologies and related strategies.

## Methods and Techniques to Pay Attention to Signals
### Stay connected to...
- Consumers
	- Consumers have a plethora of choices when it comes to technology.
	- Pay attention to behaviors, needs, and what works for consumers at scale.
- Customers
	- Customers will identify a need they have.
	- Listen carefully to customers' input and use it to enhance products and solutions.
- The Start-Up Ecosystem
	- Start-ups push the boundaries of innovation.
	- Take advantage of and identify popular emerging technologies.
	- Focus on start-ups that suit the organization's priorities.
### Look for  Industry Proof Points
- Learn from peers and competition to not miss out on emerging technology trends.
### Tech to Learn
- When you teach you open opportunities of interaction. Learn from interactions with students of different backgrounds, expertise, interests, and perspectives.

> [!EXAMPLE] Location Based Services
> 
> One of the speaker's students proposed an online dating platform that relied on user locations. The location-based idea is now used in daily life.

> [!EXAMPLE] Remote Health
> 
> One of the speaker's students wanted to track the movements of his elderly parents.
> 
> A rudimentary but effective model demonstrated the possibility of IoT sensors and web technologies, which helped support future remote health environments.

- Likewise allow yourself to learn from others who are actively creating and maintaining solutions for organizations.

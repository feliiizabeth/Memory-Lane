Video will discuss how **the tech leader plays a role in translating technology** in terms of how it impacts the organization.

There is very specific technology and very specific business languages. The role of a CIO as a business leader in the C-suite is to translate the two languages to communicate how and why the technology serves the organization to different stakeholders.

It is important to have translations as certain terms or phrases could be used in both languages but have different meanings.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ User Experience (UX) Issue
>
> 1. User complains about app response time.
> 2. CIO wants to improve app security.
> 3. CIO must find a way to balance priorities and translate the business goal of customer satisfaction with the tech goal of high security.

The CIO must communicate the balance between different objectives & results to technical and nontechnical leaders in the organization.

> Biometrics (e.g. eye scans, thumbprints, face ID) is a lot easier to use than remembering passwords.

## Prioritizing Competing Goals

### Effort vs Impact Quadrant

|  Low impact, high effort  |  High impact, high effort  |

|  Low impact, low effort   |  High impact, low effort   |

- For objectives that are high impact and high effort, the CIO might think about what the Return on Investment (ROI) is.
- Objectives that are high impact but low effort are called _low-hanging fruit_.
- Objectives that are high effort but low impact can be eliminated.

This quadrant will help balance competing goals and helps translate what an organization is trying to do.

Video will discuss how **the tech leader builds consensus around implementing digital transformation with C-suite support**.

## Key Components of Implementing Digital Transformation

- Ensuring you have the executive support and consensus to go forward with the plan.
- Understanding the priorities of the cross-functional team around you.

## Key Components of Building Consensus

| Functions                   | Priorities                             |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Sales                       | Want to recruit younger sales people   |
| Human Resources (HR)        | Want to ensure employee retention      |
| Board                       | Concerned with managing risk           |
| Information Technology (IT) | Want to implement more standards       |
| Finance                     | Want to reduce costs                   |
| Customers                   | Need consistent or better service      |
| Legal/Compliance            | Focused on security and eSign validity |

To help build consensus for a project that may cost more money that expected, demonstrate how the project will bring business value and how it'll look on a profit and loss (P&L) statement.

Make sure to bring everyone in your cross-functional C-suite along when building consensus. Understand their concerns from their perspectives.

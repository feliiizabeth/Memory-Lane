Video will discuss **mapping revenue and mapping benefits directly to project expenses to better communicate its overall value**.

> [!QUESTION] How do you map revenue or other benefits to the expense of building your project?
>
> One way to do this is to think about financial proxies for the value of the project.

## Financial Proxies for the Value of a Project

- Reduced employee turnover costs.
  - Employees turnover costs include:
    - Recruiting
    - Executive search
    - Training for new employees
    - New equipment
- Reduced customer churn costs.
  - The cost of customer churn is associated with the cost of customer acquisition.
  - If you reduce your Customer Acquisition Costs (CACs), you can say you're retaining more customers and you don't necessarily need to incur the cost of customer churn.
- Labor hours saved.
  - Automated services can save the costs that come with their manual counterparts.
- Improved response times.
  - Response time is considered to be a key customer service metric in the determination of customer satisfaction.
- Reduced Keep the Lights On (KTLO) costs through consolidation.
  - Many large organizations are maintaining and keeping apps that have been around for a long time.

## Mapping Compliance and Certification Requirements to Savings

- Most IT projects put regulatory requirements at the top of their list.
- Processes and systems may have to be upgraded to meet existing or new regulatory requirements.
- They are non-negotiable.
- Ensuring that they are met can be seen as a cost avoidance, eliminating unwanted expenses in the form of fines or penalties.

Think about which methodologies are the ones that best express the value of your project to the organization in terms of revenue, savings, or both.

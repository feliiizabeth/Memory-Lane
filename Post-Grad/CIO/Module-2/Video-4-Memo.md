Video will discuss the **hybrid IT team model** and its pros and cons.

> [!NOTE]+ Hybrid Model
>
> - **Decision-making is done in a hybrid fashion**.
> - At the hem, there may be a **Group CIO**. Each of the **divisions** in an organization will have their own CIO functions.
> - The **core set** of tech decisions are made by the Group CIO and are nonnegotiable.
> - **Division-specific** tech needs are made by the division CIOs and their teams.
> - Has **apprentice CIOs** who focus on divisional level responsibilities.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ General Electric (GE)
>
> GE has a Group CIO and many different divisions:
>
> - Aerospace division CIO
>   - Sells to the aerospace industry.
>   - Has the autonomy to make decisions about the division's workflows, tools, and technologies.
> - Capital/Finance Services division CIO
>   - Provides financial services.
> - Electrical systems division CIO
>   - Produces electrical systems and products.
>   - Decides which tools, technologies, and processes best serve the division's required standards.
>
> These divisions are different in terms of their business, customer base, and marketing strategies. Thus, their tech workflows, processes, needs, and stacks are different.

> [!NOTE]+ Silo
>
> A system, process, department, etc. that **operates in isolation** from others.

> [!NOTE]+ Cohesive, Go-to-Market Strategy
>
> A comprehensive plan that _aligns_ all marketing, sales, and distribution efforts to **effectively launch and promote a product or service**, ensuring a _unified_ approach to reach the target audience and achieve business goals.

## Pros of Hybrid Model

- Provides autonomy to division-level CIOs to make decisions on technologies and tools
- Enables faster decision-making
  - Reviewing decisions with the Group CIO is slower.
- Highly responsive to the needs of customers
- Provides leadership resilience
  - In the event the Group CIO changes, any of the division, or apprentice, CIOs can take over the responsibilities of the organization.
  - A division CIO can be assigned to oversee the CIO responsibility of another division. This allows known ideas that worked well in their division to be implemented in another.
  - Hence, we see cross-functional learning present.

## Cons of Hybrid Model

- Overlap of certain technologies, purchase & implementation decisions, and operations
  - CIOs need to be mindful of overlaps and avoid & minimize them.
- Prevents a cohesive, go-to-market approach due to silos.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Aversion to Cohesive, Go-to-Market Approach
>
> Say a customer goes to the GE Aerospace division to buy jet engines and needs capital to do so. They'll go to the GE Capital division to get help with funding.
>
> Recall: different divisions may have different technologies, workflows, and processes. The customer will end up dealing with GE in different ways instead of having a single interaction with the company.

### How to Minimize the Cons

CIOs must think about:

- How to minimize the overlap and purchase efficiency?
- How to improve the cross-functional operations of the tech stack?
- How to stitch a cohesive, go-to-market strategy to retain customers?

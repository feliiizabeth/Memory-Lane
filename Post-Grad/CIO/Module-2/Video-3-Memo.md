## Pros of Decentralized Model

- Autonomy to choose tools and technologies
  - Each functional unit would make these decisions based on what would best fit their daily workflows.
  - There's a philosophy that not one tool does not fit all the needs of an organization.
- Provides higher employee satisfaction
- Aligned with the stakeholders needs
- Encourages experimentation
  - Pushes the technology envelope.
- Encourages user experimentation throughout an organization

## Cons of Decentralized Model

- Results in an overlap of tools and technologies
- Results in low cost efficiency
- Creates complexity
  - Problems: Operational challenges, continuous deployment issues, insecure environments.
- Gives rise to shadow IT
- Presents challenges to manage security, privacy, and/or compliance disciplines.
  - These challenges are oftentimes handled by the CIO and their team.

### How to Deal with the Cons

CIOs must...

- Have rigorous guardrails.
- Establish and communicate guardrails with all functional units.
- Build trust with all functional units & leaders.
  - Trust gives way for stakeholders and functional leaders to be more willing to listen and comply to CIO suggestions and guardrails.
  - It's imperative for a CIO to frequently communicate their needs and questions to both groups to remain aligned and avoid the cons of the decentralized model.

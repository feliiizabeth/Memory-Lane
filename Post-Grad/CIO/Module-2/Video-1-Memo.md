## Expectations Vary Across Functional Teams

- **Sales teams** interact with customers and bring in new business.
- **Engineering and technology teams** develop software, products, and services.

CIOs must understand that different functional teams have different expectations for technologies and tools.

## Factors That Help Manage Employees' Expectations

  - Certain tools and technologies are necessary for everyone (e.g. collaboration tools/stack).
- Employees' prior experience levels
  - Important to meet their expectations while balancing cost efficiency, agility, security, and productivity.
- Employees' knowledge about outside tech
  - They are familiar with the tech and tools available in their industry.
  - They can provide solutions they've previously used in the field or in other aspects of their lives.
- Generational expectations
- Regional investment, security, and agility
- Transparency in decision-making
  - Not possible to please all stakeholders all the time.
  - CIOs must be able to explain to employees why a decision was made, why a tool is unavailable, why a tool is being used in a particular way, etc.
  - CIOs must communicate effectively, ensure broader participation of all internal stakeholders, and answer employees' questions objectively & truthfully in detail.
- Target the employee experience (EX)

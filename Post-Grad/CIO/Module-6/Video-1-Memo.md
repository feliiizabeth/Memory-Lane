Video will discuss the **keys to problem solving as an entrepreneur**.

You could be doing the right thing and solving the wrong problem. Or you could be doing the wrong thing and trying to solve the right problem.

Understand the problem to get clarity on whether to solve it or not.

> [!NOTE]+ Pilot
>
> A **small-scale, experimental project** to test the feasibility, effectiveness, and impact of a new idea, project, service or process.

> [!NOTE]+ Proof of Concept
>
> A **small-scale test or demonstration** that validates whether a product, service, or idea is feasible and viable before investing resources in full-scale development.

## Solving Problems

- Think creatively about the problems
- Decide what not to do
- Solve the underlying problem
- Use pilots and proofs of concept to understand the situation

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Recovering Cost of Sales to Acquire a New Client
>
> **Problem**: No way to charge back the cost of sales.
>
> **Desired Solution**: Create a program that would get the cost of sales charged back to clients.
>
> **Actual Solution**: Assign a sales prospect number beforehand.
>
> - If they become a client, all the costs associated with them can be mapped.
> - If they don't become a client, it would be noted as a cost.
>
> **Outcome**: Received an additional chargeback of $5 million a month.
>
> **Problem Solving Strategies Utilized**:
>
> - Did it as a pilot
> - Did it for prospects who became customers
> - Mapped back cost of sales to paying clients
> - Charge clients for expenses
> - Did proof of concept

Video will discuss what it takes for tech leaders to make the **business case** for an emerging technology.

> [!NOTE]+ Making a Business Case
>
> Is about **communicating the benefits of emerging technologies** to all stakeholders.
>
> CIOs take the lead in such discourses. Emerging technologies do not come free. CIOs must make the business case for investing in an emerging technology.

## Business Case Questions for CIOs

- Why must the organization...
  - consider the new technology?
  - do this today?
  - invest in the emerging technology, and what will be the impact on the business?
- Why is the emerging technology essential for the present condition?
- Why is it necessary to follow the new technology?
- What are the business outcomes and benefits from the emerging technology?

## Focus Questions

Does the technology...

- provide a significant (not incremental) improvement to the current goods and services?
  - **Quantify** the significant contribution with sufficient examples.
    - Does it improve the scale of your product/service?
  - Provide **qualitative** explanations of the benefit.
    - Does it improve customer experience?
- improve cost efficiency?
- improve the organization's profitability?
- create a new market entry?
- create a better employee experience?

Set the bar high and use that bar to ask the above questions.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Auto Insurance Industry
>
> A CIO of an auto insurance company proposed investing in mobile applications so drivers can use them in the event they got into an accident. Refer to the "Auto Insurance Industry" example in [Timing Is Everything](./Video-2-Memo.md) for more information.
>
> **Benefits**:
>
> - Reduces call center calls (more costly because humans are involved).
> - Provides better customer experiences (customers can easily interact with the company).
> - Helps with increased data collection and analyzes risk patterns.
> - Creates risk profiles and helps get appropriate insurance premiums.
>
> The CIO asked and answered the questions relevant to making a business case and acquired the investment. That company did better as a result.

## Different Aspects of Investment Strategy

- The board looks for the big picture
- The CFO looks for quantitative data
- Employees look for purpose
- Customers look for benefits

It's important for CIOs to tailor the explanation behind their business case for these different groups.

### Customer Questions

- How does investing in technology help shape the business?
- How will I benefit from this?
- Will the product experience be like that of the outside market?
- Can the product be obtained cheaper than the outside market price?

CIOs have to have a talent for **storytelling** when it comes to stakeholders and justifying the emerging technology investments that they want to make in their organizations.

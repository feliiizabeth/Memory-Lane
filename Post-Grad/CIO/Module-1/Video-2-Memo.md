Video will discuss how crucial **timing** is in the success and failure of emerging technologies.

> [!NOTE]+ Metaverse
>
> A **virtual-reality space** in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.
>
> **Core ideas**:
>
> - Creating persistent, shared virtual worlds
> - Users can interact, create, and participate in social and economic activities
> - Mixing virtual and real-world elements

> [!NOTE]+ Second Life
>
> A **multiplayer virtual world** in which users can create an avatar for themselves and interact with other users and user-created content in a multi-user online environment.

## Too Soon

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Google Glass
>
> Was an AR embedded device that would serve as a new way of interacting and consuming information via glasses.
>
> The tech community was excited, but Google had to abandon Google Glass and allocate its resources elsewhere. Google Glass failed to scale and prove its value.

### Question the Viability of an Emerging Technology

- Why is it...
  - helpful?
  - interesting
  - essential to solve a problem/need?
  - crucial to create a new experience?
- Is there an alternative?

Ask these questions to yourself, your team, and your customers.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Google Glass (_Again_)
>
> There were constraints to its technology that were not fully understood or explored.
>
> **Examples**:
>
> - Privacy. What are the implications of Google Glass on the privacy of information?
> - Safety. Does Google Glass steer your attention away from your physical environment and lead to accidents?
>
> The lack of use cases & value and constraints led to the downfall of Google Glass.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Videophone
>
> Despite the widespread use of video technology nowadays, it is not something new. It was invented in the mid-twentieth century by AT&T.
>
> **Constraint**: It took a long time for it to become scalable and widely available because underlying infrastructure for a good streaming experience was absent.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Metaverse
>
> Some of its core ideas were established in the context of _Second Life_.
>
> **Constraint**: Many wonder what the specific use cases that Metaverse will deliver are and how they connect to the real world.

## Too Late

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Auto Insurance Industry
>
> This industry took a while to adopt Web 2.0 technology to process claims at a faster rate.
>
> **Example:** Mobile Applications.
>
> - A smartphone can enable a driver who was in an accident to take proof of their car damage and share it with an insurance company.
> - An insurance assessor can look at the shared media and provide a quote for repairs.
> - The insurance assessor can also provide the driver with information to the nearest authorized repair shop using location-based services.

### Effectively Leverage Emerging Technologies

- Be a fast follower
- Find different ways to reach the newer tech trends

### Fell Behind?

- How quickly can you catch up?
- What caused the delay? Was it...
  - The organization's process, culture, and/or investment priorities?
  - A failure to read and analyze the signals of an emerging technology well?
  - A competitive analysis gap?

Ask these questions when you've missed an emerging technology to correct that structurally and culturally in your organization. Do so to avoid falling behind when the next emerging technology that can be beneficial to your organization comes along.

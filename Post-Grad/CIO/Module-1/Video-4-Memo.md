Video will discuss what it takes for tech leaders to be the **disrupter** and not the disruptee.

- Technologies evolve rapidly to meet customer expectations. Likewise, customer expectations also evolve rapidly.
- CIOs must tie evolving technologies and customer expectations together to stay ahead and avoid being disrupted.

## Disruptor Example

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Amazon
>
> Amazon started as an online book seller. However, they evolved using emerging technologies and created a marketplace of products and solutions. They then used existing infrastructure to deliver new services.
>
> Their competition had to evolve. Many traditional businesses (e.g. bookselling, data center service providers) were disrupted.
>
> They developed many emerging technologies (e.g. cloud at scale, machine learning).

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Kodak
>
> Kodak cameras used traditional film and chemical processing.
>
> Then, digital technology evolved rapidly and make the digital camera landscape available. Eventually, many companies had their own digital camera products, leaving Kodak behind.
>
> As digital cameras became prevalent, another tech evolution was afoot. Powerful, smart cameras that were built into smart phones overtook digital cameras.

Companies that are not quick to react to rapid evolutions of technology are left behind with their business models significantly impacted.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Blockbuster
>
> A company that rented out movies on DVD and video cassette out of brick-and-mortar stores.
>
> Blockbuster was offered the chance to create digital video streaming solutions but declined because they believed in the physical model.
>
> The company is nonexistent now as real-time video streaming is the standard nowadays.

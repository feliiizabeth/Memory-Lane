## How Organizations Can Leverage AI

- By developing an objective, foundational understanding of AI.
  - Know how it is going to be relevant to your organization.
- By developing a taxonomy of specific use cases that have been solved using AI.

## Different Branches of Artificial Intelligence

- Machine Learning
  - Branches: Deep Learning and Predictive Analysis.
- Speech
  - Branches: Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text.
- Natural Language Processing / Natural Language Understanding
- Expert System
- Vision
  - Branches: Image Recognition and Computer Vision.
- Robotics

Each of the above branches play a big role in our lives.

## AI Questions CIOs Should Ask

- **Why** does anyone want to use AI?
- **What** problem will it solve for the organization?
- **How** will it solve a problem for the organization?

These questions must be answered truthfully.

## Use Case of AI: Important Questions

- Does it require first-party data?
  - If it does, do you have first-party data?
  - If you don't, do you have a meaningful way to acquire it (via purchase or in a partnership of another company)?
- Do the regulations allow the use of first-party data?
- If yes, do customers agree to the use of first-party data?
  - It's important to ensure high standards of privacy with the customers.
- How will you govern the use of data?
- Does the organization have the right process and structure to use AI?
- Does the use of AI align with the necessary skills within the organization?
  - Can you recruit it?
  - Can you build those skill sets if you don't have it?
  - Do you need to rely on a partner to provide those skills?
- Does the organization follow the usage of buy-in from the business stakeholders?

It's okay to fail, but one must learn from mistakes and examine what did/didn't work to better leverage emerging technology and solve business problems moving forward.

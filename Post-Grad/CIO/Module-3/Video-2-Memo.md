Video will discuss the **impact of employee experience** (EX) on enabling a culture of innovation in the workplace.

CIOs must focus on EX because it impacts employee productivity, creativity, engagement, trust, and innovation. Having productive, creative, and engaged employees leads to a better culture of innovation.

## Tenets of Best-in-Class EX

- Invest in modern tools and technologies
- Invest in education and training of employees
	- This is how you get the best out of the tools and technologies investments because employees understand what the purpose of investments and tools for them.
- Show transparency of decisions to employees
	- CIOs must explain...
		- Why a new tool was selected
		- Why a new process needs to be implemented
		- Why a new workflow was designed
		- How their experience will be impacted
		- How they can provide feedback
		- How they can communicate exceptions or needs
- Have listening tours with employees and internal stakeholders
	- Examples:
		- Physical tours
		- Surveys and electronic feedback
		- Personal interactions
		- A CIO tech council
		- Champion groups
- Communicate frequently and meaningfully with employees
	- Some employees prefer email, steady-state web pages, or collaboration tools.
	- Other employees prefer in-person- or video-conferencing-hosted sessions.
	- Important to meet where the employees are.
- Listen to all ideas because they can come from any employee

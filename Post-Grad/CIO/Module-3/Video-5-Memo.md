Video will discuss the "**innovator mindset**" and how it can help an organization leverage innovation in impactful ways.

Video was inspired by *The Innovator's DNA: Mastering the Five Skills of Disruptive Innovators* by by Clayton Christensen, Hal B. Gregersen, and Jeff Dye

## The Five Strands of the Innovator's DNA

- Questioning
	- Start with asking "Why?"
	- Question the status quo.
- Observing
	- Observe surroundings and customers.
	- Observe customers' customers.
	- These observations will help in understanding workflow patterns, what works, and the gaps that need innovation.
- Networking
	- Build cross-discipline networks.
- Experimenting
	- Trials don't end in failure, they end in acquired knowledge of what doesn't work.
	- Don't just fail fast but learn forward.
- Associating
	- Associate ideas from different functions and products.
		- Does it create a new capability for a product line?

## The Role of Observation in Innovation

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Single-Use Products
> 
> In some parts of the world, some economically disadvantaged people do not have the means to buy a full bottle of shampoo.
> 
> This observations led to the development of single-se packaging and products (which were more easily attainable). It also led to the production of travel-size packages to fulfill travel needs.

> [!EXAMPLE]+  Portable X-Ray Machines
> 
> There are rural areas that find themselves far away from hospitals.
> 
> Because of need, the X-ray machine became portable to be carried to remote locations. Later on, portable X-ray machines were taken to patient rooms when required.

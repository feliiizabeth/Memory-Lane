Video will discuss the **role of the tech leader in setting expectations for achieving tech transformation goals**.

## Setting Expectations

- Identify your closest partners, champions, and sponsors.
  - Keep them close to ensure that they are taking part in the credit and benefits of the success of an implementation.
- Identify potential detractors.
  - Not everybody wants your project to succeed perhaps because they've been there done that or they failed in their approach to do something similar.
- Identify the key relationships.
  - Not just the relationships you're involved with but also the ones of others like those of the c-suite.
- Operationalize the business strategy and define the right metrics.
  - Think about how to measure the success of your project.
  - Define the right metrics according to the stakeholders and expectations.
- Communicate expectations, progress, and risks of the project.
  - Better to communicate frequently than infrequently.

Setting expectations helps involve people in decision-making processes.

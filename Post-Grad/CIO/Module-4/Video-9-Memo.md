Video will discuss the **process of making a business pitch and a template to develop one**.

## A Business Pitch Template

1. Introduce yourself and the issue
2. Define the problem
3. Talk about the target market
4. Explain your proposed solution
5. Discuss your progress
6. Show your strategy to generate revenue
7. Describe the competition and the risks
8. Describe how your team will be able to accomplish the project

This template fits well with digital transformation projects. It's like a business pitch for a start up inside your own organization.

## How to Manage Risk

- Pay attention to executive support who keep changing their minds.
  - Make sure you have strategies to continuously reaffirm executive support for your project.
- Get key executive support for any transformation project.
  - Rethink what you're doing and reposition it in a way to get necessary executive support.
- Encourage the team to identify things that may go wrong.
  - Having structured meetings to hear what your team's input is and address those concerns.

Innovation always brings risk.

## Approach to Manage the Risk of Innovation

- **Phase 1**: Ideate due to disruptive forces/ideas/competitors.
  - Run through the risks.
  - What would be the legal or regulatory ramifications?
  - Does it impact security?
- **Phase 2**: Protype.
  - Break down parts of the bigger picture and work on those smaller components.
- **Phase 3**: Develop.
  - Think about how to make a product with capable features and value.
- **Phase 4**: Operationalize.
  - Think about what needs to be changed whether it be security, customer service, training, etc.
- **Phase 5**: Pilot.
  - Select a small group of people to use the new technology.
  - The environment does not have to be fully built. When that is successful and you've gotten feedback, that should inform your production environment.
- **Phase 6**: Build.
  - Another round of testing can take place with a bigger group.
- **Phase 7**: Scale.
  - Then you can tell your customers about the capability you have available.

Sometimes these steps are skipped. Instead of failing in small pieces and less risky phases, people may encounter a major failure at Scale.

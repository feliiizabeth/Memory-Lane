# C-Suite

Who is sitting at the C-suite table?

- Chief executive officer (CEO)
- Chief financial officer (CFO)
- Chief marketing officer (CMO)
- Chief risk officer (CRO)
- Chief information security officer (CISO)

Questions to ask regarding the C-suite and tech:

- How well do your business partners understand technology?
- How well does the board understand technology?
- What are their attitudes towards technology?

Reporting structure is about who reports to whom and who brought in whom. It's important to understand interpersonal dynamics before making your project pitches to the C-suite.

  - The organization, particularly in the IT department, is named after the system it looks after.

## How Organizational Structure Can Be Impacted

> [!EXAMPLE]+ A New Mobile or Internet Channel
>
> You're migrating to a new mobile or internet channel and will begin welcoming mobile and internet customers.
>
> - How would migrating to a mobile channel or an internet channel change the organization?
> - Is the customer service representative prepared to help with the mobile device?
>
> Some of the early adapters of mobile and internet tech were used to store/branch walk-ins.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Digital Banking
>
> You're going from a fully onsite branch based bank to digital.
>
> To support digital banking, the organizational structure may:
>
> - Have more in-person tellers.
> - Reduce the number of branches.
> - Increase the number of customer service representatives on the phone.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Public Health System
>
> NYC converted the largest public health system's use of paper to electronic medical records.

The organizational structure and dynamics will impact how you view digital transformation.

Video will discuss **how organizational structure impacts the dynamics of the C-suite and other areas of the organization**.

## Questions and Considerations for Understanding the Current Dynamics

- Is the executive team relatively new or established?
  - When a new CEO wanted to refresh the technology.
  - When a new CIO is hired by the existing executive team.
- Is the organization currently in a growth or in a shrinking phase?
  - Find out if the organization is growing or whether it is trying to shrink.
  - Know whether the organization is shrinking in order to obtain a better stock price or because it is to be sold.
- Is tech viewed as a cost or an investment?
  - Know whether the CIO is viewed as a necessary but replaceable cost of doing business.
  - Approach things in your organization differently if your function (tech) is viewed as an investment.
- What is the organization's risk appetite?
  - There may be a lack of risk appetite.
  - Assess how much the organization wants to change versus saying they want to change.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Facebook CISO vs. COO
>
> Facebook was dealing with a lot of fake and disinformation posts from another country.
>
> The CISO raised concerns about these posts to the C-suite, but they were never raised to the board. After some time, the CISO notified the board about these international activities. The COO had a dramatic confrontation with the CISO. The COO said the CISO threw them under the bus. The CISO did not report the concern to the COO but instead reported the concerns directly to the board.
